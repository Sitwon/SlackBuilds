bumblebee (NVIDIA Optimus support for Linux)

Bumblebee daemon is a rewrite of the original Bumblebee service,
providing an elegant and stable means of managing Optimus hybrid
graphics chipsets. A primary goal of this project is not only to
enable use of the discrete GPU for rendering, but also to enable
smart power management of the dGPU when it's not in use.

Bumblebee can work with either the nouveau or nvidia drivers,
however the nvidia-driver package conflicts with some Mesa and
X.org libraries (libGL.so and libglx.so). Also, the nvidia-kernel
package installs an X.org conf file that prevent X from loading
with the Intel GPU. If you want to use the nvidia driver, use
the nvidia-driver-bumblebee and nvidia-kernel-bumblebee packages.

Building requires libbsd and help2man

Runtime requires VirtualGL and bbswitch (optional but recommended)
