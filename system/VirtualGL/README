VirtualGL (virualized 3D graphics hardware)

VirtualGL is an open source package that gives any Unix or Linux
remote display software the ability to run OpenGL applications with
full 3D hardware acceleration.

With VirtualGL, the OpenGL commands and 3D data are redirected to a
3D graphics accelerator on the application server, and only the
rendered 3D images are sent to the client machine. VirtualGL thus
"virtualizes" 3D graphics hardware.

This requires libjpeg-turbo
