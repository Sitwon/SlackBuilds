This is the proprietary binary video driver from NVidia for the X.Org
X-server. This package does not include the kernel-module - it is a
part of the nvidia-kernel-bumblebee package at SlackBuilds.org.

Installing the 32-bit compatibility libraries is available, so pass

COMPAT32="yes" ./nvidia-driver.SlackBuild

This version is modified to work with bumblebee on systems that support
NVIDIA Optimus.

This also requires the nvidia-kernel and libvdpau package from SlackBuilds.org.
