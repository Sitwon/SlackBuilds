This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia driver.
You also need the nvidia-driver package from SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=2.6.38.8 ./nvidia-kernel.SlackBuild

This version is modified to work with bumblebee on systems that support
NVIDIA Optimus.

The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.
